title: Pollard's $\rho$ Algorithm
...


### Lab Assignment 3 - Public Key Cryptography, UBB-CS Year 3
#### Popa Alex Ovidiu, group 936

Problem Statement: Pollardâ€™s $\rho$ algorithm. \ The implicit function will be 
\begin{align*}
f(x) = x^2 + 1
\end{align*}  

but it will also allow the use of a function f given by the user.

Proposed Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a runner function for Pollard's $\rho$ algorithm for an arbitrary number and function.
\item Implement tester functions to check the results against already known factorizations.
\item Implement a function to plot the size of the result of Pollard vs the number of iterations needed to achieve it.
\end{enumerate}

Pollard's $\rho$ method aims to find a non-trivial factor of a given composite number (n=p*q), and bases itself around two important principles: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Floyd's Tortoise and Hare cycle detection algorithm 
\item The Birthday Problem
\end{enumerate}

To put it shortly, *Floyd's Tortoise and Hare principle* is inspired from the children story, in the sense that we have two pointers, one for each "animal", and one progresses slower than the other one, and they will eventually meet if there is a cycle to be found. \
I think the best example to understand it in the field of CS, or at least that is how I managed to grasp the concept, is to think about how you would find a cycle in a Linked List: you would take a fast pointer, which always skips an element, and a slow pointer, which takes them one by one. The "hare" will catch up with the "tortoise" at a certain lap, as the "hare" loops repeatedly, and thus prove that there is a cycle and its starting point is where they met.   

The *Birthday Problem* says that in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday with a certain probability P. Naively, P reaches 100% when n=367, because the number of days covers more than a year, however P reaches 99.9% when n=70. \
This is closely related to the notion of mutually exclusive events in probability and statistics, which says that P(A) = 1 - P(nonA), meaning that if event A happens with a probability P(A), then its complementary event nonA happens with probability 1 - P(A). \

Euler's algorithm for gcd implementation, needed for Pollard's algorithm below. 

~~~~~{.python}
<<gcd>>=
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        r = x % y
        x = y
        y = r
    return x

Basic implementation of primality testing- see the explanation below as to why it's needed.

~~~~~{.python}
<<Primality>>=

from math import sqrt
def prime(x):
    if x<2 or (x>2 and x%2==0):
        return False 
    for d in range(3, int(sqrt(x)+1),2):
        if x%d==0:
            return False 
    return True

Method which calls the function f for value val, the trick being that f is a string of the form '\[1,0,2]', which represents the function 
\begin{align*}
f(x) = 2x^2 + 1
\end{align*}   

~~~~~{.python}
<<funcall>>=
def funcall(f, val):
    coeff = f.replace('[','').replace(']','').split(',')
    s = 0
    for i in range(len(coeff)):
        s+=int(coeff[i])*(val**i)
    return s

Pollard's $\rho$ Algorithm implementation, following the algorithm from the lecture.
Now, where do the two principles presented above come into play in the implementation? \
Well, if we take a look at xj = f(xj-1) and xj+1 = f(xj) = f(f(xj-1)), we can easily associate the first number to the "tortoise" and the second one to the "hare", as the latter is always one step ahead.
This decreases the cost of computing numerous GCD calculations, and ensures the cycle can be found. \
The idea is that when we use a polynomial, say x^2+1, we generate a sequence of numbers which seems random, but it's in fact pseudorandom, as it can be replicated by also using another function. \
I think this is where the birthday paradox is used, however how the 'pseudorandomness' is influenced by the paradox is not fully clear to me. \
As far as I've tested, using f=x^2-2 requires the algorithm to do about 10x more iterations until it finds the solutions, and I believe that it's because it takes longer to find a cycle. \
\textit {General remark about the algorithm:} it runs indefinitely for prime numbers, so the number is checked beforehand for primality.

def pollard(n, x0, f):
    x = [x0]
    j = 1
    while True:
        x.append(funcall(f, x[-1]) % n) # tortoise
        x.append(funcall(f, x[-1]) % n) # hare
        d = gcd(abs(x[2 * j] - x[j]), n)
        if 1 < d < n:
            return d
        elif d == n:
            return None
        j += 1

Pollard Function runner, with x0 going from 2 until a solution is found. \
Another possibility which wasn't implemented is to randomly generate a new free element of the coefficient.

~~~~~{.python}
<<PollardRunner>>=
<<PollardImpl>>
<<Primality>>
def pollardRunner(n, f):
    if prime(n):
        return None, None
    x0 = 2
    it = 1
    result = pollard(n, x0, f)
    while result is None:
        it+=1
        x0+=1
        result = pollard(n, x0, f)

    return result, it

Plot the number of iterations for large numbers (iterations vs. size of the largest factor), for numbers between two bounds defaulted to 1000 and 100000. 

~~~~~{.python}
<<Plotter>>=
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
from math import log
<<PollardRunner>>

def plot(x=1000, y=100000, f='[1,0,1]'):
    data = {}
    for i in range(x,y): 
        factor, it = pollardRunner(i, f)
        if factor is not None: 
            data[it] = int(log(factor, 2))
    result = data.items()
    xAxis = [pair[0] for pair in result]
    yAxis = [pair[1] for pair in result]
    plt.title('iterations v factor size (bits)')
    plt.xlabel('iterations')
    plt.ylabel('sizeof factor (bits)')
    plt.scatter(xAxis,yAxis, color='red')
    plt.show()

Required tests for Pollard's Rho Algorithm. \
First testing a big number to make sure it also works for larger sizes.

~~~~~{.python}
<<BigNumberTest>>=
<<PollardRunner>>

def testBigNumber():
    n=10967535067
    f='[1,0,1]'
    factors = [104723, 104729]
    return pollardRunner(n, f)[0] in factors

@
~~~~~

Each test calls the function for a specific number and tests the result against the already known divisors of the number. \
Notice that it is divisors instead of factors due to the fact that Pollard's Rho algorithm might result in a number which isn't necessarily a prime factor, but can be a composition of smaller ones. \

Runner command example: 

~~~~~{.bash}
notangle pollard.md >pollard.py && python pollard.py -nr 10967535067 -func [1,0,1]
~~~~~

Use -nr to change the number and -func to change the function. 
They default to n=7031 and f=x^2+1 if they are both omitted.
The function defaults to f=x^2+1 if the -f flag is omitted.
